# Breast Cancer Classification 🩺🔬

## Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates. This project focuses on classifying breast cancer histopathology images using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a robust model that can assist in the automated diagnosis of breast cancer.

## Dataset 📊
The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle - Breast Histopathology Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images/data). It contains histopathological images labeled as either **benign** or **malignant**. The images are derived from breast biopsy slides and provide valuable insights for cancer classification models.

## Features 🏗️
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.
- **Multiple ML Models**: Experimentation with various models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and other classifiers.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for thorough assessment.
- **Visualization**: Data insights through graphs and confusion matrices.
